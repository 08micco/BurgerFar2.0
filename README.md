# Purpose

This project was created to automate a Burger King campaign as a demonstration and proof-of-concept. It automates the sign-up process and checks for potential wins. You will need a **catchall** email address and if CAPTCHA solving is required, a **2captcha** API token.

# Adaptation

Although originally developed for a Burger King campaign, this repository can be adapted to any Scratcher campaign. Simply update the relevant **endpoints** and **signup data** to suit your needs.
